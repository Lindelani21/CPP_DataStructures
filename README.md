# Data Structures Demonstration in C++

This project provides a simple command-line interface to demonstrate the implementation and basic operations of multiple fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++. It is designed as a learning tool to help users understand how these data structures work internally.

## Features

- **Insertion Sort:** Demonstrates sorting an array using the insertion sort algorithm.
- **Sequential Search:** Demonstrates searching an element sequentially in a collection.
- **Stack Operations:** Shows basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **Queue Operations:** Demonstrates enqueue and dequeue operations on a queue.
- **Linked List:** Implements and showcases singly linked list operations.

## Sample Menu
1. Insertion Sort
2. Sequential Search
3. Stack Operations
4. Queue Operations
5. Linked List Operations
6. Exit

## Project Structure
- main.cpp: Contains the main program loop and menu handling.
- Separate functions implement demonstrations for each data structure/algorithm.

## Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- Compatible C++ compiler (g++)
